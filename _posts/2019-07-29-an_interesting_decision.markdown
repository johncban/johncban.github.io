When I was 14 years old, I saw my friend who's much more senior to me doing HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) in a Microsoft Notepad Editor and I was fascinated when he run a simple marquee text to the Internet Explorer.

It was year 2000 when I first encountered coding, I was in junior high school and most seniors are doing basic HTML class for their college endeavour and to get into Computer Science.  I tried to learn doing basic HTML just for fun, but its year 2000 the syntax is much longer and it was HTML 4.

It was fun at first but due to preassure from school and other extracullicular activities I have to stop and wait until I reach Senior High School.

So Senior High here I come, I created my first web page even though its kind of dingy sorrounded with gif pictures and lots of marquee. It was great and interesting, at the same time I am looking forward and still looking forward to be a software engineer.

Unfortunately, as I began college I decided to be an IT major instead but while in the progress of the course I used my skills form High School from HTML, CSS to C++ and Java. Its tough and challenging but it didn't change my pursuit to be a programmer because its an interesting decision I have to make and to make that decision into reality.
