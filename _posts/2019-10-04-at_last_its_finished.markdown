My [first CLI project](https://github.com/johncban/newsjournal) was finished and passed since September 19 of 2019. It was an interesting project but at first I thought I am not gonna make it and repeat thr project.

However, I learned something and that is determination.

Determination is the only key to challenge the challenging parts of the project while the other is imagination. 
Using imagination to picture the most possible and logical results but if I can't picture it the co-study groups and co-slack groups are always available for help.

For instance, I keep asking my self..., how I can refresh the article I scraped but fortunately my section lead assisted me to tackle the issue.

In my CLI, I scrape news from https://www.marketwatch.com/latest-news and the code below is part of the NewsArticle class that represent as an array of scraped articles.

```
def get_article_headlines
        Newsjournal::NewsArticle.articles
    end
```

My section lead asked me, "Remember how we clear the array?" and that's it! it refreshed my mind. It sound ironically as is, that my problem is about refreshing the article lists but it takes a question to [refresh my memory about clearing arrays](https://apidock.com/ruby/Array/clear).

After 2 weeks before September 19, tweaks and checks are always in my mind then as the day comes on that faithful evening at Flatiron School NY campus the technical interview begins.

The questions are mostly technical as per requirement, at first I got nervous but as my know how kicked in from what I learned from the previous lessons everything is just smooth sailing like a calming breeze from the Battery Park.

After the technical interview questions and live coding, the interviewee passed me and she told me that she likes my concept of scraping news. 
I was very happy and relieved, and now I am on the way for Sinatra!
